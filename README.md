This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This sample react app is created to act as the client for the Lottery Contract I created while following Stephen Grider's lessons. See(https://github.com/cfactolerin/solidity-lottery-contract)

Committed to git for my reference
